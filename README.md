# Travel-Planner

When we travel, we book flight tickets from X website, accommodation from Y, and book local
adventures separately. During our travel, we need to hop from website to website to check the
timings, locations, and other important stuff. Imagine the hustle if you have connecting flights or
flights from different airlines and you are running on the clock, the trip seems no longer relaxing
at this point. Additionally, as you begin your journey, you will be too occupied in keeping track
of all the attractions you have booked or are looking to cover and may miss something important
or worse you may find the attraction is closed for the day. That is why we are proposing a new app
that would keep track of all your journey-related schedules, attraction details, and other important
details all in one application.
